images
    make smaller
    loop into numpy arrays

create X array containing image arrays

^ all this possibly from keras.preprocessing

create Y array containing label vectors
    from the dataframe we already have

split into train/validation datasets

replace last layer of resnet model

lock deep layers (all except 1? 2?)

train with our X_train, Y_train
    earlystopping
    modelcheckpoint
    sigmoid

for submission:
    download test images
    probably make smaller, load into numpy arrays
    create a dataframe and format according to sample_submission.csv

submit, enjoy!
