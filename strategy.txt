[x] images
        make smaller
        loop into numpy arrays

[x] create X array containing image arrays

[x] create Y array containing label vectors
        from the dataframe we already have

[x] split into train/validation datasets

[ ] replace last layer of resnet model

[ ] lock deep layers (all except 1? 2?)

[ ] train with our X_train, Y_train
        earlystopping
        modelcheckpoint
        sigmoid

for submission:

[ ] download test images
        probably make smaller, load into numpy arrays
        
[ ] predict labels for test images
        
[ ] create a dataframe and output according to sample_submission.csv

[ ] submit

[ ] enjoy!
